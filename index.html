            <p>This is an intuitive bookstore. There was supposed to be a lot more here, but its already late and I spent a bunch of time trying to get the one big feature to work. Which thankfully it does.</p>
            <p>So enjoy the fully generated page after clicking on a card in the "search" page. Proposal said it would have searching but its already two days late and I do not have the time.</p>
            <p>You can navigate to 'view' though it will not generate any content unless you select a card from 'search'. I wasn't super sure about the fluid navigation thing</p>
